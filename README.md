## Introduction

Java is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely used for building web applications, Android apps, and enterprise solutions. In this course, you will learn the fundamental concepts of Java programming, including syntax, data types, control structures, and object-oriented principles.

## Course Content

This course covers the following foundational topics in Java:

1. **Introduction to Java**
   - What is Java?
   - History and Evolution of Java
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

2. **Basic Syntax**
   - Java Syntax and Structure
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Operators

3. **Control Flow Statements**
   - Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
   - Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

4. **Methods**
   - Defining and Calling Methods
   - Method Overloading
   - Scope and Lifetime of Variables

5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
   - Classes and Objects
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism
   - Encapsulation
   - Abstraction

6. **Basic Data Structures**
   - Arrays
   - ArrayLists

7. **Exception Handling**
   - Try-Catch-Finally Blocks
   - Throwing Exceptions
   - Custom Exceptions

8. **Basic Input and Output**
   - Reading from and Writing to Files
   - Console Input and Output

## Getting Started

To get started with this course, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   `bash

## Installation
To run the Java examples and exercises, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Java website.

## Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
A Code Editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
To compile and run Java programs, use the following commands:

`bash
javac YourClass.java   # Compile the Java source code
java YourClass         # Run the compiled Java program`

## Usage
This repository includes various Java files demonstrating the foundational concepts. Each file is organized into folders based on the topics covered. To get the most out of this course:

Study the Java Files: Each Java file contains examples and exercises for the respective topics.
Complete the Exercises: Work through the exercises to practice your skills.
Refer to the Documentation: Read the comments and documentation within the Java files for explanations of concepts.
Example Commands
To compile a Java file named HelloWorld.java, use:

`bash
javac HelloWorld.java`
To run the compiled HelloWorld class, use:

`bash
java HelloWorld`
## Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Understand the basic syntax and structure of Java programs.
Use Javaâ€™s data types, operators, and control flow statements.
Define and use methods, including method overloading.
Apply object-oriented principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Work with basic data structures like arrays and ArrayLists.
Handle exceptions and perform basic file input/output operations.

## Code Examples
Here are a few code examples from different topics covered in this course:

HelloWorld.java
`bash
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}`
Basic Calculator

import java.util.Scanner;
`bash
public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();
        System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
    }
}`
Basic Exception Handling
`bash
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = 10 / 0;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("This block always executes.");
        }
    }
}`
